        <h1 class="title">Who's this guy?</h1>
        <div id="col1">
          <p>Hello, my name is Douglas J. Honeycutt, but everyone I know calls me <span class="highlight">Joey</span>. I'm based out of Jasper, Alabama in the good ol' U.S. of A, I am a husband and father, and I am also kinda good at computering. As a matter of fact, web design, development, and programming have been my hobby and my passion for years. I now hope to be able to put my skills to work in an environment where they will be put to the test in the professional market.</p>
          <p>I cut my teeth on programming back in the late '90s with an old copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">Microsoft QBasic</a>. I really didn't know what I was doing at thie time, but making the magic box make pretty colors made me happy. I like to look at those first footsteps into this brave new world as the foundation for everything I've done since, and attribute the core of my fundamental understanding of coding to it.</p>
          <p>Not long after, I discovered HTML from an old catalog file on a CD we had laying around when I started tinkering and modifying it. My parents got me a set of books on web design for christmas that year and I read the covers off them. By the late '00s I had a couple of web pages online I'd coded myself and paid out of pocket to host. </p>
          <p>The learning didn't stop there: Since then, I've come to know and love many other languages and technologies, including Python, JavaScript, web development essentials such as PHP, SQL, and SASS, and dabbled in C++ and Node.js. Python specifically granted me an insight into programming that has allowed me to quickly acclimate to other new environments with rapid progress and absorption.</p>
          <p>Up until now, my only real workplace experience has been an unfortunate mixture of food service and retail which, while it has paid the bills thus far, is not my preferred career path by any means. That's where you come in! If you're reading this, I'll bet you're either a recruiter or prospective client. If you like what you see here, then with your help I can escape the dreaded Retail Rut&trade;!</p>
        </div>
        <div id="col2">
          <p>When I'm not working to further develop my coding skills, I like to spend my time on a number of other hobbies.</p>
          <p>I'm an avid fan of tabletop RPGs, including Dungeons and Dragons, Shadowrun, Vampire: The Masquerade, and FATE. I've built quite the little homebrew world for D&D that I call Vestraad, and I'm extremely comfortable in the GM's chair (though I haven't had the time I'd like to devote to the hobby since the birth of my son).</p>
          <p>My love of fantasy isn't contained solely to TTRPGs: I'm also an avid reader and have my eyes on a number of authors and series: Patrick Rothfuss' "The Kingkiller Chronicle", Jim Butcher's "The Dresden Files", Terry Pratchett's "Discworld", Martin Scott's "Thraxas", and Kristen Britain's "Green Rider" to name a few I'm currently involved in and/or awaiting the next publication of. I could talk about my favorite books all night, but instead I'll just drop a link to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/ridleyofzebes">my Goodreads page <i class="fab fa-goodreads"></i></a>.
            <br /><span style="font-size: 10px;">(The Lord of the Rings and The Chrinocles of Narnia are included by default, also I've fninshed them and don't anticipate any further releases.)</span></p>
          <p>I love music of all kinds. Some of my favorite artists are Broken Bells, Jonathan Coulton, Glass Animals, Alt-J, David Bowie, Queen, Sabaton, Blind Guardian, Sublime, and Flogging Molly, in no particular order. If that particular mix sounds good to you, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/RidleyofZebes">here's a link to my Spotify <i class="fab fa-spotify"></i></a>.</p>

        <p class="centered">It's a little empty here. I like to think of it less as 'full of cobwebs' and more as 'the paint is still wet'. This is where you come in! While I may not have done work for any companies that paid real money (yet!), I do have a nice selection of projects I would encourage you to check out over on my <a href="https://github.com/RidleyofZebes">GitHub <i class="fab fa-github"></i></a>. If you like what you see, then maybe we can work out something that'll give you a polished, professional product and/or employee and help me fill this section out a little. Hop over to my <a href="#contact">contact information</a> and let me know!</p>
        <p>Here are the skills in my current toolkit:</p>
