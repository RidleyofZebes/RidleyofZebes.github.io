        <div id="col1">
          <p>Hello, my name is Douglas J. Honeycutt, but everyone I know calls me <span class="highlight">Joey</span>. I'm based out of Jasper, Alabama in the good ol' U.S. of A, I am a husband and father, and I am also kinda good at computering. As a matter of fact, web design, development, and programming have been my hobby and my passion for years. I now hope to be able to put my skills to work in an environment where they will be the most use.</p>
          <p>I cut my teeth on programming back in the late '90s with an old copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">Microsoft QBasic</a>. I really didn't know what I was doing at thie time, but making the magic box make pretty colors made me happy. I like to look at those first footsteps into this brave new world as the foundation for everything I've done since, and attribute the core of my fundamental understanding of coding to it.</p>
          <p>Not long after, I discovered HTML from an old catalog file on a CD we had laying around and started playing around and modifying it. My parents got me a set of books on web design for christmas that year and I read the covers off them. By the late '00s I had a couple of web pages online I'd coded myself and paid out of pocket to host. </p>
          <p>The learning didn't stop there: Since then, I've come to know and love many other languages and technologies, including Python, JavaScript, web design essentials such as PHP, SQL, and SASS, and dabbled in C++ and Node.js. Python specifically granted me an insight into programming that has allowed me to quickly acclimate to new environments with rapid absorption.</p>
          <p>Up until now, my only real workplace experience has been an unfortunate mixture of food service and retail which, while it has paid the bills thus far, is not my preferred career path. That's where you come in! If you're reading this, hopefully you're a recruiter or prospective client.</p>

      <section id="portfolio"><h1>Portfolio</h1><p class="centered">It's a little empty here. I like to think of it less as 'full of cobwebs' and more as 'the paint is still wet'. While I may not have worked for any companies that paid real money, I do have a nice selection of projects I would encourage you to check out over on my <a href="https://github.com/RidleyofZebes">GitHub</a>!</p></section>
